Import pygame library
Initialize the game library
create a screen variable for storing the pygame display
set the caption for the application to "Relaxing Soccer"

create the field variable and load the assets/field.jpg image
rotate image 90 degrees
scale image to display size

create the ball variable and load the assets/ball.png
scale the ball to 50 width and 50 height
create ball_x to store the horizontal location
create ball_y to store the vertical location
create ball_x_dir to store the horizontal direction and set to 1
create ball_y_dir to store the vertical direction and set to 1

create a clock variable as set to teh pygame library Clock class
create a keep_going boolean variable and default to True

while keep_going
    clock to 30 frames

    set the ball_x variable = ball_x + (5 * ball_x_dir)
    set the ball_y variable = ball_y + (5 * ball_y_dir)

    if ball_x < 0:
        change direction by setting the ball_x_dir = ball_x_dir * -1
    if ball_x < screen.get_height()-50 # which is the size of the ball
        change direction by setting the ball_x_dir = ball_x_dir * -1

    if ball_y < 0:
        change direction by setting the ball_y_dir = ball_y_dir * -1
    if ball_y < screen.get_height()-50 # which is the size of the ball
        change direction by setting the ball_y_dir = ball_y_dir * -1
