Uh, uh
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big {color} jacked up {vehicle}
Rollin' on thirty-fives
{sitting_next_to} by my side
You got that sun tan {clothing} and {footware}
Waitin' on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another {drink}, yeah
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you to {location}
But you look like the kind that likes to {activity}
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the {river} River
Catch us up a little {dinner} dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my {music_genre} {music_genre_2} mixtape
Little {music_genre_artist}, a little {music_genre_2_artist}
Might just make it {weather_type} (make it {weather_type})
You can hang your {clothing} on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you to {location}
But you look like the kind that likes to {activity}
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the {river} River
Catch us up a little {dinner} dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
My kind or your kind, it's this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh, gonna get our love on
Oh, time to get our buzz on
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you {location}
But you look like the kind that likes to {activity}
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the {river} River
Catch us up a little {dinner} dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
(Oh) come on
