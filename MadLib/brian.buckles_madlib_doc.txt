Uh, uh
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on thirty-fives
Pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waitin' on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River
Catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain
Might just make it rain (make it rain)
You can hang your T-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River
Catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
My kind or your kind, it's this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh, gonna get our love on
Oh, time to get our buzz on
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River
Catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
(Oh) come on
