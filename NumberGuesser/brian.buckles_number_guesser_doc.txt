number_of_guesses int variable and set to 6.  Since it is zero based index subtract one from the total guesses we want.
winning_number int variable and using the random library set to the rand integer passing in 0  and 100
keep_going boolean variable to control the while loop
print number guesser
print simple instructions
while keep_going
    if the number_of_guesses greater than or equal to 7
        set keep_going equal to false
        break out of current loop iteration
    ask the user for a number and set a new variable user_guess
    check if user_guess is a number
        if user_guess is not a number let the user know
        subtract 1 from the number_of_guesses
        break out of current loop iteration
    create a variable and set to conversion of user_guess to integer for comparision
    check if user_guess is equal to the winning_number
        let them know they won
        set keep_going to false
        break out of current loop iteration
    check if user_guess is less than winning_number
        let the user know it is lower
    check if user_guess is more than winning_number
        let the user know it is higher
    subtract 1 from the number_of_guesses
